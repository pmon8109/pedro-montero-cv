## 👋 About Me

I'm a full-stack software consultant and business analyst with over 18 years of experience designing, building, and maintaining enterprise-grade applications across Europe and Latin America. I specialize in scalable architecture, secure development, agile delivery, and multilingual cross-functional collaboration.

I’ve delivered robust solutions for the European Commission, Council of the EU, and private sector clients — often leading end-to-end projects from MVP to production in complex legal, financial, and operational domains.
